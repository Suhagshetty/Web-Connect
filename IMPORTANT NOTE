Note on Missing Code Files
Unfortunately, during the process of pushing the code to GitHub, some files were not successfully uploaded, and as a result, a few parts of the codebase are missing.

If you need the full codebase or would like to access the missing files, feel free to reach out to me directly.

You can contact me via:

I'll be happy to provide you with the full project files upon request.

CHEERS!!!
