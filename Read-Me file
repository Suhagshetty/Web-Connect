Web-Connect

This project enables users to interact with any website through a chatbot interface. By appending a website URL to http://localhost:3005/, users can access a personalized chatbot for that specific site. For example:

http://localhost:3005/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli

The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) and content extraction systems to provide seamless, dynamic question answering tailored to the webpage content. Backend services use Upstash Redis for efficient data storage, ensuring fast and reliable interactions.
